            <h2>Describe the problem</h2>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>It is very difficult to keep track of the people (e.g. customers) that are at a certain point in time at a given location. This information could help mall owners place their shops more efficiently, festival organizers place their arenas or food stands better or help institutions monitor certain places to prevent accidents or even atrocities.</p>

            <h2>Your solution</h2>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>Our solution is a crowd monitoring system that relies solely on Wi-Fi signals to keep track of the people at a certain geographic location. Research has shown that the Wi-Fi technology can be used to track pedestrians because smartphones periodically broadcast Wi-Fi signals in the near zone in order to detect new routers to which they could connect. These signals are called probe requests and contain valuable information such as the sender MAC address which can act as a main identifier for us. These addresses are randomized and this makes the work a lot more difficult, but here will come in place our product which will estimate through ML algorithms and more the number of devices detected.</p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>In the end, the customer will have access to an interface with the number of detections for every interval of the day (the interval will generally be 5 minutes or as much as the customer wishes). The data will come from sensors (Raspberry Pis) that are deployed by us at the required location.</p>
            <h2>Customer segment</h2>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>Mobile crowd sensing will radically transform several sectors of our economy such as: environmental monitoring and transportation, business, healthcare and social networks. We can have a wide range of customers: from governments that want to start implementing the idea of a smart city, to entertainment businesses that may want better organized facilities for their customers.</p>
            <h2>Competition</h2>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>The domain we are focusing on is currently in the incipient phase. We could only find a few competitors:</p>
            <div>
                <div class="competition">
                    <h3><span class="tab"></span>Senstar</h3>

                        </li>
                        <li>They are using machine learning to detect people in surveillance cameras.</li>
                        <li>This might have similar results to our product but it is far more expensive and complex</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3><span class="tab"></span>Optex</h3>

                        </li>
                        <li>This product is more reliable on counting the number of persons in a crowd, but at the same time it’s more rigid: you have to install the pillar in the image below, and people would have to enter/exit a fixed entrance.</li>
                        <li>While this solution works very well for a supermarket, it is not feasible for an open space event, for example a street festival.</li>
