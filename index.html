            <h2>Describe the problem</h2>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>It is very difficult to keep track of the people (e.g. customers) that are at a certain point in time at a given location. This information could help mall owners place their shops more efficiently, festival organizers place their arenas or food stands better or help institutions monitor certain places to prevent accidents or even atrocities.</p>

            <h2>Your solution</h2>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>Our solution is a crowd monitoring system that relies solely on Wi-Fi signals to keep track of the people at a certain geographic location. Research has shown that the Wi-Fi technology can be used to track pedestrians because smartphones periodically broadcast Wi-Fi signals in the near zone in order to detect new routers to which they could connect. These signals are called probe requests and contain valuable information such as the sender MAC address which can act as a main identifier for us. These addresses are randomized and this makes the work a lot more difficult, but here will come in place our product which will estimate through ML algorithms and more the number of devices detected.</p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>In the end, the customer will have access to an interface with the number of detections for every interval of the day (the interval will generally be 5 minutes or as much as the customer wishes). The data will come from sensors (Raspberry Pis) that are deployed by us at the required location.</p>
            <h2>Customer segment</h2>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>Mobile crowd sensing will radically transform several sectors of our economy such as: environmental monitoring and transportation, business, healthcare and social networks. We can have a wide range of customers: from governments that want to start implementing the idea of a smart city, to entertainment businesses that may want better organized facilities for their customers.</p>
            <h2>Competition</h2>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>The domain we are focusing on is currently in the incipient phase. We could only find a few competitors:</p>
            <div>
                <div class="competition">
                    <h3><span class="tab"></span>Senstar</h3>

                        </li>
                        <li>They are using machine learning to detect people in surveillance cameras.</li>
                        <li>This might have similar results to our product but it is far more expensive and complex</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>This product is more reliable on counting the number of persons in a crowd, but at the same time it’s more rigid: you have to install the pillar in the image below, and people would have to enter/exit a fixed entrance.</li>
                        <li>While this solution works very well for a supermarket, it is not feasible for an open space event, for example a street festival.</li>

            <!--Milestone 2 - Deadline 8 Nov 2023 10 AM-->
            <h1>Customer Discovery</h1>
            <div class="CustomDiscovery">
                <h2>How we identified the problem?</h2>
                <p><span class="tab"></span>Identifying the problem of effectively tracking people at a specific location, such as in events, public spaces, and venues was a crucial thing when developing our product.</p>
                <p><span class="tab"></span>First of all, we thought about it based on our personal experience. This could be: noticing long queues at stores, overcrowded events, or difficulty in buying food/drinks at a festival with a large venue.</p>
                <p><span class="tab"></span>Secondly, we often used to hear complaints among our friends/family/news after attending such events/festivals. These complaints are often related to: long waiting times, overcrowding, or inaccessible stores/courts at a festival.</p>
                <p><span class="tab"></span>Last but not least, we investigated the existing crowd management solutions in the previous milestone and realized there are very few competitors, and the focus on this problem is still in the incipient phase.</p>
                <h2>What we thought is a solution for the problem?</h2>
                <p><span class="tab"></span>Our solution is a crowd monitoring system that relies solely on Wi-Fi signals to keep track of the people at a certain geographic location.</p>
                <p><span class="tab"></span>Research has shown that the Wi-Fi technology can be used to track pedestrians because smartphones periodically broadcast Wi-Fi signals in the near zone in order to detect new routers to which they could connect.</p>

These addresses are randomized and this makes the work a lot more difficult, but here will come in place our product which will estimate through ML algorithms and more the number of devices detected.</p>
                <p><span class="tab"></span>In the end, the customer will have access to an interface with the number of detections for every interval of the day (the interval will generally be 5 minutes or as much as the customer wishes). The data will come from sensors (Raspberry Pis) that are deployed by us at the required location.</p>
                <h2>Our plan for customer discovery</h2>
                <p><span class="tab"></span>Our plan is to conduct an online survey with people from different businesses (mall employee, restaurant manager, festival volunteer) and understand how our product can help them, based on their responses and honest opinion.</p>
                <h2>The process described in detail</h2>
                <p><span class="tab"></span>We created an online form, which can be found <a href="https://forms.gle/iU9pzYfGscGsM7pv9" target="_blank">here</a>. This form was sent to known people (friends, colleagues) who work for companies that could benefit from our product.</p>
                <p><span class="tab"></span>One of the people that answered our form is Corina Vlascianu, who is a manager at a clothing store (Bershka) in Mall Parklake.</p>
                <p><span class="tab"></span>One answer that we want to highlight is regarding how she would plan to integrate our product in her store:<br>
                    <div id="content">
                        <div class="testimonial">
                            <blockquote>
                                I see great potential in using your product to enhance the shopping experience for our customers. Some ideas could be: allocating the staff more efficiently (during busy hours/days vs more quiet days). Or for when we host special sales, we can use your system to predict and plan for increased foot traffic. This will help us arrange promotions and allocate the staff well in advance, ensuring that we make the most of these opportunities.

                                One of our biggest issues during the festival was to identify bottlenecks, congestion points, or areas with excessive queuing. Having a product that will help us get this kind of internformation in real time would be really nice.

                    A key question that everyone was asking us is: 
                    <em>“Can we predict how many people will be here tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, at this hour?”.</em>
                </p>
                <p><span class="tab"></span>
                    Our answer is yes, based on data previously collected at the customer location. To increase our chances in selling our product, we can deploy our device in public spaces near potential customers and collect data for a couple of days/weeks.    
                </p>
                <p><span class="tab"></span>
                    This way, when a customer asks the question above, we can already offer them some results based on the data previously collected.    
                </p>

                <h2>Do we consider that we are ready to move to the Customer Validation stage?</h2>
                <p><span class="tab"></span>
                    I think we are in a good position, based on the feedback received.
                </p>
                <p><span class="tab"></span>
                    A good argument would be the fact that customers seem to encounter the problem that we are trying to solve.
                </p>
                <p><span class="tab"></span>
                    This gives value to our product and enables us to solve it.

                    Good afternoon! We are WiSenser team and we have recently developed a great product that utilizes WiFi signal-based sensors to monitor the flow of people.
                    <br><span class="tab"></span>Before we dive into the details, could you share some of the specific needs or challenges you're currently facing in your restaurant?

                    <span class="tab"></span>Well, I've been trying to calculate the profit per table based on the number of people. I currently use a camera with facial detection, but it can't differentiate between customers and staff. It's causing some inaccuracies in my calculations.

                <div class="bubble right">
                    <span class="tab"></span> I understand the frustration. Our solution precisely addresses this issue. Our WiFi-based sensors can distinguish between customers and staff with high accuracy. This means you'll get more reliable data for your profit calculations per table. It not only helps in understanding the crowd flow but also ensures that your profit calculations are more precise and reflective of actual customer numbers.

                <h2>Estimate Potential Market Share after launch (Year 1 - Year 5)</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Year 1:</strong> In the first year, the product might achieve a relatively modest market share in Romania, considering factors such as initial product introduction, market awareness, and establishing a customer base. Assuming a conservative estimate, the market share could range from 1% to 5% of the total addressable market.</li><br>
                  <li><strong>Year 2:</strong> By the second year, assuming successful marketing efforts, product enhancements, and increased awareness, the market share could potentially grow. A reasonable projection might see an increase to around 5% to 10% of the total market share in Romania.</li><br>
                  <li><strong>Year 3:</strong> In the third year, with continued market increase, expanding our customer base and potential improvements in the product offering, the market share could grow more substantially. It might reach around 10% to 15%.</li><br>
                  <li><strong>Year 4:</strong> By the fourth year, assuming sustained growth momentum, market acceptance, and possibly entering new markets or segments, the product might further increase its market share. An estimate might range from 15% to 20% of the total market share.</li><br>
                  <li><strong>Year 5:</strong> In the fifth year, the product could potentially consolidate its position in the market, benefiting from brand loyalty, a matured customer base, and potentially expanding into international markets or new industries. A projected market share might range from 20% to 25% or higher of the total addressable market.</li><br>
                </ul>
            
                <h2>Total Market Value & Your Market Share</h2>
                <p><span class="tab"></span>Due to the poor number of crowd monitoring products in Romania, our business stands at the forefront of an untapped market. The limited availability of such solutions presents a substantial opportunity, positioning our offerings for high market value. With few competitors catering to this specific need, our innovative crowd monitoring products utilizing sensors hold immense potential. Consequently, this situation primes our business for significant market value and growth in Romania's burgeoning crowd monitoring landscape.</p>
            
                <h2>Conclusion Regarding Profitability</h2>
                <p><span class="tab"></span>The profitability of a crowd monitoring startup can depend on various factors, including the market demand, competition, the effectiveness of the technology, and the ability of the startup to execute its business strategy.</p>
                <p><span class="tab"></span>It's important to note that startups often face challenges and may take time to become profitable. A thorough market analysis, a well-defined value proposition, and effective execution of business strategies are critical for the success and profitability of a crowd monitoring startup. We are hopeful that in Romania we will have success because there are a small number of competitors.</p>

                <p><span class="tab"></span>We strategically designed our website to showcase data from sensors installed in two distinct buildings (Precis and EC), portraying real-time information through various graphs. Our goal was to create an user-interface with a nice design which is easy to use.</p>

                <p><span class="tab"></span>Our decision of how to display the data came from our understanding of the needs of our primary audience, a potential client base that predominantly interacts with and analyzes information on a day-to-day basis (for instance, a possible client can be STB). By providing this daily snapshot, we aim to cater directly to their preferences and facilitate quick, regular insights into the sensor data. Moreover, we incorporated weekly and monthly formats to offer comprehensive statistical analysis and evaluation tools. These longer-term views enable in-depth trend analysis, performance evaluation, and strategic decision-making (for clients like restaurants).</p>

                <p><span class="tab"></span>To ensure the reliability and functionality of our MVP, we engaged in rigorous testing and validation processes with potential customers representing diverse sectors.</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Our initial discussion involved a restaurant owner, who expressed keen interest in our product. After showing him our MVP, he had a really good feedback and agreed to a probation period, opting to have our sensors installed in his restaurant. If after the trial period the results are up to expectations, then he proposed to offer us the sum of 2000 euros.</li><br>
                  <li>Another critical validation came from a STB Director and Chief Engineer. He mentioned that if we guarantee the data obtained by our product is highly accurate, he is willing to recommend us for inclusion in STB auctions (in order to gain a contract with them).</li><br>
                  <li>We also validated our MVP with an UPB teacher, with whom we already have an ongoing collaboration. He showed great support and wants to extend our product to be used in the whole university (at the moment the sensors are placed just in EC and in Precis). He also promised to offer support in searching for sponsorships from private collaborators.</li><br>
                </ol>
                
                <p><span class="tab"></span>This promising feedback from various potential customers across industries serves as a testament to the functionality, accuracy, and potential widespread applicability of our website's sensor data display and analysis capabilities.</p>
